MSLiveBlur
==========

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mspensieri/MSLiveBlur/master/demo.gif)

The MSLiveBlurView dynamically blurs the content on the screen and updates at the given interval. 
Subviews will not be blurred but will instead appear on top of the blurred area.

I use a condensed version of [GPUImage](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) to do the blurring.

*Note:* Performance on the simulator is abysmal for blur radius >5, try it on an actual device - it's much faster!

# Usage

Drag the MSLiveBlur folder into your XCode project, and include the required system dependencies:
* CoreGraphics.framework
* UIKit.framework
* Foundation.framework

#### For live blur:

```objc
#import "MSLiveBlur.h"
[MSLiveBlur sharedInstance].isStatic = NO;
[[MSLiveBlur sharedInstance] blurRect:someView.frame];
```

#### For static blur:

```objc
#import "MSLiveBlur.h"
[[MSLiveBlur sharedInstance] blurRect:someView.frame];
```

then, to update manually:

```objc
[[MSLiveBlur sharedInstance] forceUpdateBlur];
```

#### Adding subviews:

```objc
UIView* overlayView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100)];
[[MSLiveBlur sharedInstance] addSubview:overlayView];
```

# Todo:
* Figure out how to only blur views beneath so as not to require a new window
* Different shapes (ex: rounded corners)

# Done
* Live blur with variable interval
* Live blur appears on top of the application and blurs underneath
* Specify the size of the blurred area so it does not blur the entire screen (i.e. actually use the given frame)
* Tint color
* Support multiple areas at once
* Allow subviews on top of the blurred area
* Landscape
* Enable touches on subviews
